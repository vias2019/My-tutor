## Application Overview

This application is meant to allow for private tutors and teachers to manage the following aspects of their business:

### Schedule Transparency

Teachers and student have access to the same calendar data so they are clear on scheduling expectations.  In the future, the student view will have added functionality of selecting a class period to be able to request cancellation.

### Payment Transparency

Students and teachers view the same data regarding monthly fees owed and if students have paid.
Additionally, students are able to pay the student fees directly through the application, using the BrainTree API, by paypal.
Teachers are also able to manage their expected income and business goals with the financial projections.

### Future Development
The application will, in the future have functionality that includes:
content management - allowing for links and plugins (metronomes, assessments, etc.)
paid tiers that allow teachers to sell additional services and products
mobile development (React Native)

Enjoy!!
